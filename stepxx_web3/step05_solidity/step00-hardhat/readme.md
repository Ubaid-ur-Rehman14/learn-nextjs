#What is hardhat?
Hardhat is a development environment for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain. It provides a suite of tools and libraries that make it easy for developers to write, compile, and test their smart contracts. It also provides a local blockchain network for testing and debugging smart contracts. Hardhat is commonly used by Solidity developers to build decentralized applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other blockchain-based projects.


#Why we use hardhat?
hardhat can help developers save time, reduce errors, and improve the quality of their smart contract code.
