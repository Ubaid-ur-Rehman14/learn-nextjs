# In this step we leran about Integers
Solidity value types, such as integers, are variables that store data within a defined memory space and pass a duplicated value when used within a function or an assignment.

# Types of Integers
There are two types of Integers 
# Signed Integers
# UnSigned Integers


# Signed Integers
Signed integers: Signed integers can hold both negative and positive values. 
# UnSigned Integers
 Unsigned integers: Unsigned integers can hold only positive values along with zero.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
