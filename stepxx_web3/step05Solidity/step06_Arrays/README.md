# In this step we learn about Arrays 
Arrays are linear data structures that store a fixed-size of elements of the same data types which are stored in contiguous and adjacent memory locations.

# Types Of Arrays 
There are two types of Arrays in Solidity

# Fixed Size arrays
# Dynamic Size array

# Fixed Size Array

A fixed size array means the array that does not grow or shrink in terms of its capacity.

# Dynamic Size Arrays

A dynamic array is a type of array in which the length of the array can be changed at runtime. This means that the size of a dynamic array can be adjusted to fit the amount of data it needs to store, allowing for efficient use of memory.


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
