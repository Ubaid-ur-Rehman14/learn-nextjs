# In this step we are learning about functions in solidity
Solidity functions are self-contained modules of code that accomplish a specific task

# Types of solidity Function
# Getter Function
# Setter Function

# Getter Function 
In Solidity, a getter is a function that returns a value.

# Setter function

 In Solidity, a setter is a function that modifies the value of a variable

# Pure and View

# Pure
In Solidity, a function that doesn't read or modify the variables of the state is called a pure function.

# View
In Solidity, a function that only reads but doesn't alter the state variables defined in the contract is called a View Function .


# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
